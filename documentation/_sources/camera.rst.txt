Using Camera
============

To use the camera, you need to install `openCV <https://opencv.org/>`_. We require the contrib version, which provides support for ArUco tags.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install opencv-contrib-python

Capturing Images
----------------

.. code-block:: python
    
    from nuro_arm import Camera

    cam = Camera()

    img = cam.get_image()


Using ArUco Tags
----------------

ArUco Tags are visual markers that look like QR codes.  Due to their unique appearance, they can be easily located in an image using a computer vision algorithm.  By placing them on an object, we can determine the object's 3D position, which can be used for a robotics task.

To generate a PDF of ArUco Tags, use the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    python nuro_arm/camera/generate_aruco_tags.py

To locate ArUco Tags in an image:

.. code-block:: python

    from nuro_arm.camera.camera_utils import find_arucotags

    tag_size = 0.025 # size in meters
    tags = find_arucotags(img, tag_size)
