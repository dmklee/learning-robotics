NURO Arm
========

*nuro_arm* is a great introduction to programming robots for high school and early-college students.  The API provides intuitive, high-level commands to control a low-cost robotic arm.  For those unable to purchase the robot, we offer a simulator that works on any operating system.  We believe *nuro_arm* is a valuable educational tool for hands-on learning of concepts ranging from writing for-loops to designing reinforcement learning algorithms.
