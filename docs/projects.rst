Project Ideas
=============
Further details coming Fall 2022...

Stacking Cubes
--------------

Locate, grasp, and place cubes using aruco tags. [Advanced] Impose constraints
like blue cube must be on red cube, and use planner to determine stacking order


Face Tracking
-------------

Using a camera held by the gripper, write controller that follows someone's face
around as they move. [Advanced] anticipate person's motion for smoother tracking


Throwing Objects into Bin
-------------------------

Design motor sequence to throw object some distance. [Advanced] Parametrize
motion to throw object at a specific world position.


Tactile Mapping
---------------

Use motor feedback to "map" an object.  [Advanced] classify the object


Top-Down Picking
----------------

Given top down camera, use computer vision techniques to locate objects and 
determine grasp pose.  [Advanced] use machine learning to generalize to arbitrary
objects.
